    "Secure JWT-based authentication and input validation with rate limiting and logging"
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User registers or logs into the platform using Auth API and receives JWT token",
    "User accesses the interactive map showing water bodies and quality readings with filtering options",
    "User clicks on location markers to view detailed water quality data and historical trends",
    "User receives real-time risk level updates color-coded by severity on the map and dashboard",
    "System triggers AI models to predict potential pollution events and alerts users accordingly",
    "User can view, resolve, or dismiss alerts through Alerts API endpoints",
    "User can search and view detailed monitoring locations using Locations API",
    "Admins and users can update their profiles securely using authenticated API endpoints"
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "All API endpoints respond with correct data formats and appropriate HTTP status codes",
    "User authentication adheres to JWT standards with secure password hashing",
    "Real-time data updates reflect accurately in the frontend dashboard within a 15-minute window",
    "AI/ML predictions match expected model performance metrics and confidence levels",
    "Alerts trigger correctly on threshold violations with proper severity classification",
    "Frontend UI is fully responsive and accessible across devices and browsers",
    "Integration with official government data sources updates consistently with no data loss",
    "Database queries return paginated, filtered, and sorted results as specified",
    "Security measures including rate limiting, CORS, and logging are implemented and tested"
